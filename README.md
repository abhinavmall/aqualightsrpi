# aqualightsrpi

Aquarium Lights management using Raspberry Pi 3 and a 8 channel relay.

A Node.js project to automate lights of my freshwater planted aquarium. Uses "onoff - https://github.com/fivdi/onoff" for GPIO access. Using "pm2@2.0.0 - http://pm2.keymetrics.io" for process management (restart/reload).

Automation was necessary so as to ensure adequate light for all the plants as well as control algae growth owing to excess light. Currently controlling two lights & filter pump but planning to control CO2 release valve too. Looking for appropriate hardware.
